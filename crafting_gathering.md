# Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn - Crafting and Gathering Resources

I put a lot of effort into leveling every crafting and gathering job in the game to their maximum, and then went ahead and melded my crafting and gathering sets to their **absolute** maximum because I'm a masochist. I hope to save people a lot of time and gil by documenting what I learned along the way. This will include gear sets, locations and unlock steps for collectable appraisers and scrip exchanges, crafting rotations for collectables at every level, and more.

# How to Read This

Here are a few tips on how to read this document:

- In tables, repeated values in a column are shown by empty cells. (If there's a better way to show this, open an issue in this repo and let me know.)

- If you see text displayed in `a monospace font like this`, that means it's a single command to enter.

```
If you see a block of text displayed like this,
it's the body of an in-game macro that you need to create.
Each consecutive command will be on its own line.
```

# Leveling Jobs

There are a number of ways to level crafting and gathering jobs in the game.

Between levels 1 and 50, you'll be spending your time primarily focused on job quests, Grand Company supply turn-ins, and crafting/gathering levequests.

Once you reach level 50, the fun begins. You'll unlock collectables. I found that they're the best way to level crafting and gathering jobs, and that's where this document comes in. Eventually, I want to cover the lower levels as well, but this is where I started.

# Unlocking Collectable Appraisers

When you reach level 50 and complete the Heavensward main story quest "The Better Half," you'll be able to take and complete the quest "Inscrutable Tastes." That unlocks collectables for all crafting and gathering jobs, up to level 56. You'll have to complete additional quests to unlock each additional tier of collectables.

# Gear Sets

## Level 50

- **Craftsmanship**: 357
- **Control**: 367
- **CP**: 294

The Red Coral/Electrum accessories can be purchased from Seghuie in Ishgard, located in The Pillars, X: 7.4, Y: 10.3.

Crafting harder things with this gear (collectables at level 56 and 58) gets a bit rough. If you augment with food (Tsai tou Vounou HQ), you can maximize collectability at that level, if the cost of the food is worth it to you. I didn't provide a rotation for this.

- **Craftsmanship**: 417
- **Control**: 477
- **CP**: 283

I've listed the accessories here only for the sake of completeness. I recommend using the Electrum accessories from the level 50 set above until you hit level 60.

Continue using your primary and secondary tools from the level 50 set.

## Level 60

### Recommended

- **Craftsmanship**: 943
- **Control**: 843
- **CP**: 381

The Keep's Sets are job-specific; you will require a new armor set for each crafting job you're leveling.
The Handmaster's Set (accessories) are not job-specific, and can be used across all crafting jobs.

|Job Level|Set|Item Level|Item|Source|
|-|-|-|-|-|

### Alternate

- **Craftsmanship**: 900
- **Control**: 813
- **CP**: 378

This set (armor and accessories) is usable by all crafting jobs, but it's a crafted set and therefore far more expensive than the Keep's/Handmaster's Sets, and for worse stats.

**I do not recommend going this route due to the cost.**

No matter which armor set you go with, there is absolutely no reason to ever use the accessories from this set. For a universal set at level 60, get the Ironworks Armor and the Handmaster's Accessories.

No matter which route you go at this level, use the primary and secondary tools from the Keep's set.

## Level 70

- **Craftsmanship**: 1645
- **Control**: 1532
- **CP**: 400

Aside from the tools, the Handking's armor and accessories are usable by all crafting jobs, so you'll only need to buy the set once.

## Level 80

- **Craftsmanship**: 2606
- **Control**: 2457

Aside from the tools, the Handsaint's armor and accessories are usable by all crafting jobs, so you'll only need to buy the set once.

## Level 90

### Normal Set

- **Craftsmanship**: 3291
- **Control**: 3037
- **CP**: 484

This is a very solid option that will let you craft most things with excellent results. It may not meet the **craftsmanship** and/or **control** requirements for some of the top-tier items, though you may be able to overcome this by melding/overmelding the Pactmaker's and AR-Caean pieces.

### High-End Set

**Base Stats**:

- **Craftsmanship**: 3457
- **Control**: 3184
- **CP**: 486

**Stats with BiS Meld**:

- **Craftsmanship**: 3664
- **Control**: 3784
- **CP**: 573

This is the "high end" option that carries with it the full cost of crafting/acquiring high-quality endgame crafting gear. The advantage is that this set can be fully overmelded, if you're willing to devote that amount of resources into crafting.

**BEWARE: THIS IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE**. A fully overmelded crafting set can easily cost you MILLIONS of gil in materia alone.

If you WANT to do this, the current BiS materia meld is provided below. If you're not sure if you want to do this, please talk to an experienced crafter/melder first. Your gil will thank you.

# Crafting Rotations

## Collectables

These rotations assume that:

- You are using one of the gear sets listed in the previous sections;
- Your stats **exactly** match those indicated for the craft you're attempting;
- You are crafting collectable items with the exact recipe level, difficulty, quality, and durability parameters listed;
- You have all abilities available at the level indicated, including those gained by completing job quests;
- You don't get screwed by having poor condition during a critical touch action. ☹️

**IMPORTANT**: As stated above, these rotations assume your stats eactly match what's indicated for each specific craft. Even if you're using a gear set from this document, buffs can modify your stats, so always check your stats in your character window to verify that your currently effective stats are correct.

Stat differences can be caused by:
- FC buffs;
  - Eat from the Hand I (Craftsmanship +5)
  - Eat from the Hand II (Craftsmanship +5)
  - Eat from the Hand III (Craftsmanship +5)
  - In Control I (Control +5)
  - In Control II (Control +10)
  - In Control III (Control +15)
- Food buffs;
- Materia;
  - Craftsman's Competence Materia (Craftsmanship)
  - Craftsman's Command Materia (Control)
  - Craftsman's Cunning Materia (CP)
- Crafting job specializations;

If your stats differ from those specified for the craft you're attempting, you may experience the following effects:

||Low|High|
|-|-|-|
|Craftsmanship|You may not be able to make enough progress before running out of durability, causing the craft to fail.|You may accidentally complete the craft before increasing its collectability. While the craft will succeed, the collectability may be too low for an appraiser to accept, which basically equals failure.|
|Control|You may not be able to increase the quality sufficiently to meet the collectability target indicated. In the worst case, you won't be able to meet the minimum collectability requirement. If the appraiser won't take your crafted collectable, it's the same as a failed craft.|This is okay. You might reach maximum collectability before the rotation is finished, but there are no negative effects.|
|CP|You may not be able to complete the rotation at all. This typically results in failure to meet progress AND quality requiements, causing the craft to fail.|This is okay. You'll just have more CP left over at the end of the rotation, but there are no negative effects.|

I made these so that you don't need to buy (except for those level 45-49 accessories) or craft any gear or food or meld any materia. Please make sure that I didn't screw any of these up before you use them.

If there's a blank line in the middle of the macro, that means that you need to split it into two macros. Macros in FFXIV are limited to 15 lines.

## Firmament Collectables

TO DO

# To Do

There's a lot I'm still working on adding to this page. In no particular order:

- The best (by some approximation) levequests to get you from level 1 to level 50 in a given crafting job.
- Alternate crafting rotations that account for common buffs.
- Inventory of collectables at each level, and a rough estimation of how many are needed for each level.
  - This one is going to be difficult, because EXP per collectable turn-in is scaled to your current level. I'll have to make some (very rough) guesses.
- A lot of other stuff.

# Contributing

If you see something wrong or just plain stupid in here, open an issue or create a pull request with your corrections, and I'll check it out and verify it. If I can verify it, I'll merge your PR and add you here as a contributor, because you deserve some gratitude for spending your free time to help me out.
